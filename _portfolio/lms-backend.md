[cite_start]This project focused on designing the backend logic for a Learning Management System (LMS) during the **HackerRank x Dua Data** challenge[cite: 181, 182].

### ⚙️ Technical Contribution
[cite_start]As a **SQL Developer**, I transformed raw interaction logs into structured business insights by implementing advanced query logic[cite: 182, 184].

### 🛠 Key Implementations:
* [cite_start]**Complex SQL Logic**: Developed sophisticated queries using **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** to automate performance evaluation for a 10-day coding challenge[cite: 183].
* [cite_start]**Algorithmic User Segmentation**: Implemented algorithms to identify user retention bottlenecks and segment participants effectively[cite: 184].
* [cite_start]**Data Integrity**: Optimized query performance and ensured data integrity while transforming raw logs into actionable reports[cite: 184].
