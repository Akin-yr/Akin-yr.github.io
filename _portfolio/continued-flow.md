**ContinuedFlow** is a weather intelligence platform designed for high-resolution hazard monitoring, leveraging satellite-based environmental telemetry.

### 🏆 Achievement
* [cite_start]**Top 10 Finalist (Local Lead)** - NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024[cite: 34, 131].

### ⚙️ Core Technical Contribution
In this team project, I served as the **Core Logic & Data Engineer**. [cite_start]I architected the system's "brain" (`script.js`) to handle complex environmental data streams[cite: 78, 133].

#### **Key Implementations:**
* [cite_start]**Asynchronous Data Orchestration**: Engineered core logic to synchronize real-time streams from **NASA POWER API** (climatological parameters) and **Open-Meteo API** (short-term forecasting)[cite: 78, 187].
* [cite_start]**Mathematical Normalization**: Developed a specialized module to standardize heterogeneous data units and align disparate spatiotemporal structures from satellite sources[cite: 36, 134].
* [cite_start]**Robust Error Handling**: Implemented fail-safe asynchronous fetch mechanisms to ensure system reliability during high-pressure disaster response simulations[cite: 135].
* [cite_start]**Data-to-UI Pipeline**: Designed the back-end data structure that feeds processed analytics into dynamic visualization layers[cite: 81, 135].

### 🛠 Tech Stack
* [cite_start]**Logic**: JavaScript (ES6+ Asynchronous Programming)[cite: 48, 101].
* [cite_start]**Data Ingestion**: NASA Earth Observation (EO) Data, Open-Meteo Forecasting API[cite: 78, 133].
* [cite_start]**Methods**: Time-series data normalization and spatiotemporal analysis[cite: 134, 188].

### 📍 Research Context
[cite_start]This logic provides the foundational framework for my ongoing **Independent Research on Sinkhole Early Warning Systems**, where I am integrating **Deep Learning (LSTM/GRU)** to extend prediction horizons to a 3-month sub-seasonal scale[cite: 26, 85].
