[cite_start]I am a Data Science student at **VNU-HCM University of Science** [cite: 3] [cite_start]with a strong focus on the intersection of **Software Engineering** and **Applied AI**[cite: 120, 123]. [cite_start]My academic journey is marked by a GPA of **3.72/4.0** [cite: 3] [cite_start]and a passion for building robust data systems that solve real-world environmental and social challenges[cite: 20].

### 🚀 Key Highlights
* [cite_start]**NASA Space Apps Finalist**: Achieved Top 10 Finalist (Local Event) in 2024 for architecting a weather intelligence engine using real-time NASA APIs[cite: 34, 35].
* [cite_start]**Data Infrastructure Lead**: Serving as a Core Founder for **Gratus**, an international startup, where I design scalable data pipelines for IoT sensor systems [cite: 175-178].
* [cite_start]**Advanced Backend Logic**: Proven expertise in complex SQL (CTEs) and C++ system architecture, including a final exam exemption for outstanding performance in structured programming[cite: 121, 138, 154].
* [cite_start]**Research Leadership**: Vice President of the **Mathematics Club (VNU-HCMUS)**, managing technical workshops for over 500 student members[cite: 41, 42].

### 🔍 Research Interests
[cite_start]My primary research interest lies in **Multi-modal AI**, specifically fusing satellite imagery with spatiotemporal sensor data to enhance environmental resilience[cite: 7, 8]. [cite_start]I am also deeply invested in **Explainable AI (XAI)**, developing interpretable deep learning models for critical infrastructure monitoring[cite: 9, 10].

### 🛠 Technical Toolbox
* [cite_start]**Languages**: Python, SQL (Advanced), C/C++, JavaScript (ES6+), LaTeX[cite: 13, 100, 101].
* [cite_start]**Frameworks & Tools**: PyTorch (LSTM, GRU), Docker, Azure Static Web Apps, Git/GitHub[cite: 14, 15, 155, 156].
* [cite_start]**Geospatial**: ArcGIS, QGIS, Google Earth Engine, Remote Sensing (InSAR)[cite: 17, 18].
